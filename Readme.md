# Secure Deplyment Tool - Overview

The purpose of the Secure Deployment tool is to offer a secure solution for containerized applications by using Hardware-Assisted Security to protect them at runtime. This protection is achieved by executing computations in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based on hardware, thus preventing unauthorized access to data rather than transforming or dispersing it.

Exactly for the tool we expolit the TEE technology of Intel SGX. 

## **SGX Runtime**
To secure applications with the SGX TEE we use LibOS-based Runtimes. 

There are some different LibOS, in this proof of concept weâ€™re going to use Gramine; especially, using Gramine Shielded Containers (GSC) we provide the infrastructure to deploy Docker containers protected by Intel SGX enclaves. This technology transforms a Docker image into a new image which includes the Gramine LibOS, manifest files, Intel SGX related information, and executes the application inside an Intel SGX enclave using Gramine.

# Tool's operability
## Prerequisites

For the tool's operability we need: 
1) Docker image repository - Docker Hub
2) Jenkins server
3) SGX-enabled VM 
4) GSC on the VM

## Jenkins UI
We use Jenkins as a UI to make the tool more user-friendly, in fact, thanks to Jenkins, the user can simply choose from all the available images on the Docker Hub repository which image to deploy, also selecting the version; moreover, and most importantly, he can decide whether to deploy a secured container or not.

### SGX-secured_container
For the deployment of the SGX-secured container the user needs to provide Jenkins with a configuration file that allows to take advantage of this technology, the Manifest file. In this repository there is a simply example of [Manifest file](/Manifestfile.manifest)

The official manifest syntax documentation can be found at: https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manifest-syntax.html
